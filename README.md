## 🩸 Game Mantra
*A fallen Arcanist King rises from his own blood to reclaim a city slaughtered by invaders. Wield your own life force as a weapon, slaughter armies to rebuild your strength, and rescue the scattered survivors of the Dawnlight Kingdom.*

---

## 📖 Premise
You are **Velkan**, the King of the Dawnlight Kingdom and a powerful arcanist who wields both steel and blood magic. Your realm has been invaded by the allied forces of neighboring kingdoms, leaving you defeated and left for dead. But death is not the end. 

Velkan rises again, vowing to avenge his people and destroy his enemies at any cost. Explore the ruins of your city, uncover secret plots, and reclaim your throne.

## 🎮 Core Mechanics

### Unified Resource System: Blood is Fuel
Velkan does not possess a traditional mana bar. Instead, he utilizes **Blood Arts**—powerful spells that burn his own **Health (HP)** to cast. Every spell cast is a calculated risk.

### The Aggression Loop
The only way to heal is through violence. Passive regeneration does not exist.
*   **Siphon:** Executing stunned enemies restores a large, critical chunk of Blood (HP).
*   **Reaping:** Standard melee hits restore small amounts of "Temporary Blood" (which regains over time if you avoid damage).

### Movement
*   **Dash:** A high-speed horizontal dodge granting Invincibility Frames (I-Frames).
*   **Vault:** A context-sensitive action to hop over gaps or low cover (No free jumping).

## 🏛️ Design Pillars

### Darkness, Despair, and Vengeance
The atmosphere reflects the bleak reality of a fallen kingdom. Every visual and auditory element reinforces Velkan's drive for revenge against overwhelming odds.

### Narrative: Fragmented & Discovery-Driven
The deep backstory is not spoon-fed but uncovered through exploration:
*   **Environmental Storytelling:** Ruined architecture and the banners of invaders tell the history of the siege.
*   **Memory Echoes:** Interact with "Blood Stains" to witness phantom replays of how citizens met their fate.
*   **Survivor Dialogue:** Rescuing key survivors provides human context and current objectives.

### Progression & Power-ups
Players can customize their playstyle significantly through **Blood Arts**. Whether focusing on brutal melee combos or devastating blood magic, the choice is yours.

### Satisfying Gameplay
Combat is designed to generate a feeling of power and agility. Success requires mastering combos, evading traps with nimble movement, and traversing the map with speed and precision.
